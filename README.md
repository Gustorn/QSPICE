# QSPICE
Quantum Circuit Simulator

## Purpose:
This code has been written and is maintained by James Schloss. The purpose is 
to create a quantum circuit solver with SPICE-like syntax. This will hopefully
be used in research applications to simulate quantum algorithms.

More information on netlists and potential UI's will come in the future.

The development of this code will primarily be on the beta branch. 
Run a git checkout for that.
